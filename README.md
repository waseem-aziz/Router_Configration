Life Line Laboratory Network Project
Overview
Welcome to the Life Line Laboratory Network Project! This networking project aims to establish a robust and secure network infrastructure for Life Line Laboratory. The network incorporates routers, switches, PCs, and serial and Ethernet cables to facilitate efficient communication and data exchange within the laboratory environment.

Features
Routing Protocols:

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIP2)
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
Static routing
Security Measures:

Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Network Address Translation (NAT)
Port Security
Switch Security:

Employed for all communication channels to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
Centralized Management:

Three border routers strategically positioned in the center for centralized management and secure data exchange.
Network Components
Routers: Responsible for forwarding data packets between different computer networks.
Switches: Used to connect multiple devices within a network and forward data packets to their intended destination.
PCs: End devices used for data processing and communication.
Serial Cables: Used for connecting routers in serial communication.
Ethernet Cables: Used for connecting devices such as PCs and switches in local area networks.
